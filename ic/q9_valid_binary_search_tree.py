# Write a function to check whether or not a 
# Binary tree (tree where each node has up to 2 children)
# is a valid binary search tree.

# Depth-first traversal of a tree uses memory proportional to the depth of the tree, 
# while breadth-first traversal uses memory proportional to the breadth of the tree 
# (how many nodes there are on the "level" that has the most nodes).

# Because the tree's breadth can as much as double each time it gets one level deeper, 
# depth-first traversal is likely to be more space-efficient than breadth-first traversal, 
# though they are strictly both O(n)O(n) additional space in the worst case. The space savings 
# are obvious if we know our binary tree is balancedâ€”its depth will be O(\lg{n})O(lgn) and its 
# breadth will be O(n) O(n).

# We do a depth-first walk through the tree, testing each node for validity as we go. 
# A given node is valid if it's greater than all the ancestral nodes it's in the right 
# sub-tree of and less than all the ancestral nodes it's in the left-subtree of. 
# Instead of keeping track of each ancestor to check these inequalities, we just check the 
# largest number it must be greater than (its lower_bound) and the smallest number it must be 
# less than (its upper_bound).


# Complexity: O(n) space, time
